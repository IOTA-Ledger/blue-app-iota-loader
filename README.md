# Load the IOTA app onto the Ledger Nano S
Environment to load the IOTA app onto the Ledger Nano S

Here we try to use natively available crypto logic to create IOTA Seeds and sign transactions on the fly. It's currently heavily in alpha so don't trust this yet!

See [blue-app-iota GitHub repository](https://github.com/IOTA-Ledger/blue-app-iota) for the original source code.

See [Ledger's documentation](http://ledger.readthedocs.io) to get more info about the inner workings.
